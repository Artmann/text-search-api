- Use assertions like tiny-invariant to throw on invalid states.

## Code Style

- Don't use CONSTANT_CASE. This is not JAVA.
- Use entire words as variable names. This is not Go. For example `request`
  instead of `req`.
- Use punctuation.
- Use whitespace to break up code to make it easier to read. Put a blank like
  after const groups and control flows and before return statements.
- Order things in alphabetical order by default. If applicable order by
  accessiblity level first, then alphabetical order.
- No any: Use proper types or unknown
- Prefer Nullish Coalescing: Use ?? over ||
- No Floating Promises: Always await or handle promises
- No Non-null Assertions: Avoid ! operator
- Single quotes
- No semicolons
- Always use bracers for control statements.

## Error handling

- Always handle errors.
- User facing errors should be easy to understand and actionable.
- Error messages must be **actionable** — tell the user what went wrong and what
  they can do about it
- When planning features, always consider what errors can occur and include the
  exact error messages in the plan

## Testing

- Put test files next to the implementation.
- Prefer `toEqual` over `toBe`
- Compare entire objects instead of single properties.
  `expect(product).toEqual({ id: 1, name: 'Cup' })`
- Use RTL to test React components.
- Unit test small, side effect free modules.
- We prefer "integration tests" that only mocks a small set of dependencies.
- Normally, we test the entire endpoint, using a mock database in esix. A good
  API test should perform a request and then assert that the correct documents
  have been created in the database.

## Prefered Tools

- Bun
